# Midi Lang

This is a compiler that turns MIDI into machine code.

## Design

Coming soon :)

## Goals

I'm doing this to learn more about compiler development, and rust development. I'm interested in programming languages, and this seems like a great way to combine that interest with love for music. I'm not aiming for a fast or easy to use language, I just want to have fun.

One of the main goals I want for the language is to be able to "play" code using a midi controller. I'll be biased towards piano-like midi controllers, since that's what I have with me. I don't want to make a compiler that requires you to write a MIDI file in plaintext, but rather program from the controller.

Since I'm doing this for learning, I'm going to try and do as much of this from scratch as i can :)

Wish me luck :)
